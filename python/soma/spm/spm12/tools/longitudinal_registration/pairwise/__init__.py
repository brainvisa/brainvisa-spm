    Registration  involves simultaneously minimising two terms.  One of these is a measure
    of  similarity  between  the  images  (mean-squared difference in the current situation),
    whereas the other is a measure of the roughness of the deformations.  This measure of
    roughness involves the sum of the following terms:
    * Absolute  displacements  need  to  be  penalised  by  a tiny amount.  The first element
      encodes  the  amount of penalty on these.  Ideally, absolute displacements should not
      be penalised, but it is necessary for technical reasons.
    * The  `membrane  energy'  of  the deformation is penalised (2nd element), usually by a
      relatively  small  amount.  This  penalises the sum of squares of the derivatives of the
      velocity field (ie the sum of squares of the elements of the Jacobian tensors).
    * The  `bending energy' is penalised (3rd element). This penalises the sum of squares of
      the 2nd derivatives of the velocity.
    * Linear  elasticity  regularisation  is  also  included  (4th  and  5th  elements).  The first
      parameter  (mu)  is  similar  to that for linear elasticity, except it penalises the sum of
      squares  of  the  Jacobian tensors after they have been made symmetric (by averaging
      with   the   transpose).      This  term  essentially  penalises  length  changes,  without
      penalising rotations.
    * The  final  term  also  relates  to  linear  elasticity, and is the weight that denotes how
      much   to   penalise   changes  to  the  divergence  of  the  velocities  (lambda).    This
      divergence is a measure of the rate of volumetric expansion or contraction.
    Note  that  regularisation  is  specified based on what is believed to be appropriate for a
    year   of  growth.    The  specified  values  are  divided  by  the  number  of  years  time
    difference.

    MR  images are usually corrupted by a smooth, spatially varying artifact that modulates
    the  intensity  of  the  image  (bias). These artifacts, although not usually a problem for
    visual inspection, can impede automated processing of the images.
    An  important  issue  relates  to  the  distinction  between  variations  in  the difference
    between  the  images  that  arise  because  of  the  differential  bias  artifact due to the
    physics of MR scanning, and those that arise due to shape differences.  The objective is
    to  model  the  latter  by deformations, while modelling the former with a bias field. We
    know a priori that intensity variations due to MR physics tend to be spatially smooth. A
    more  accurate  estimate  of  a  bias  field can be obtained by including prior knowledge
    about the distribution of the fields likely to be encountered by the correction algorithm.
    For  example,  if  it  is  known that there is little or no intensity non-uniformity, then it
    would be wise to penalise large estimates of the intensity non-uniformity.
    Knowing what works best should be a matter of empirical exploration, as it depends on
    the  scans themselves.  For example, if your data has very little of the artifact, then the
    bias regularisation should be increased.  This effectively tells the algorithm that there is
    very little bias in your data, so it does not try to model it.
